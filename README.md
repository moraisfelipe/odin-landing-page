# odin-landing-page
This is my first CSS/Flexbox project. The motivation is to develop my skills in CSS and Flexbox, putting into practice the recent knowledge I acquired in the "Foundations" course. For this project I’ll (re-)create a web page from a design provided previously by The Odin Project.


Informations about the website:

1. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
2. For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS.
